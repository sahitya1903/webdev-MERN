Paragraph on Nature 150 words
Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.

Natural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms. Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth.

Paragraph on Nature 200 words
Nature refers to the natural resources and natural surroundings. The life species in nature are interrelated and create balance in nature. They form a natural food chain through which energy is passed to all the species. The series of organisms in which each organism feeds on the one below it in the sequence is called the food chain in natural ecosystem. Food chain includes several plants, organisms, animals and other living species. This natural food chain is the source of energy for the forest species. The energy is passed from one creature to the other which helps them grow and survive.

For example in forest deer feeds on the grass and green plants and the tiger feeds on the deer. Plants get their energy form sunlight and nutrients from soil. Deer is herbivores animal. Herbivores animals depend on plants for energy and are vegetarians. Tiger is carnivorous animal. Carnivorous animals eat herbivores and sometimes other carnivorous for energy. So there is a whole chain that includes plants, herbivores, carnivorous and plants consume energy from sunlight. And there are lots of animals that eat plants and meat both. These are called omnivorous animals. For instance, black beer is an omnivorous animal. Some omnivorous also eat dead animals and those are called scavengers. Thus, the chain goes on.

All the species on earth are important for the survival of entire series of organisms and to balance the natural cycle.

Paragraph on Nature 400 words
Nature refers to the natural resources, plants, animals and other forms of living and non living things that exist naturally in the universe. One very important part of nature is the wildlife. Nature includes rich and diverse wildlife. Wildlife mostly refers to the undomesticated animal species, but also comprises other species like plant, fungi and other organisms that exist and penetrate independent of human intrusion. Wildlife is present in the entire ecosystem including forests, deserts, rainforests and grasslands. Diverse forms of wildlife can be found in these areas.

Some animals are domesticated by human beings. Human beings also use animals for personal activities or entertainment and serve them as pets taking them away from their natural habitat. Animals are also caged in the zoo for public display and this disrupts their skills to hunt their meals independently and survive wild in the nature. In modern times, interest and concern for natural environment has seen a rise. Many activists have objected to the exploitation of wildlife for human benefits.

Threats to Nature and Wildlife

Global Warming: Global warming is raising the temperature of the climate on earth and is responsible for severe natural calamities like flood, hurricanes, droughts, etc. This also causes danger to our natural environment, adding pressure to our wildlife species and their habitat. Global warming can cause loss of several wild life species.
Overuse of Wildlife: Due to rise in population there is upsurge in use of wildlife and plant species by human beings for food, clothing, medicine, pets and several other purposes. If we use more than the nature could supply then some of the species might get exploited completely.
Deforestation: Due to personal needs, urbanization and development humans are clearing away forests. Forests are important for the natural cycle of ecosystem in which several animals feed on plants. It leads to the loss of habitat of several species. Forests are also important to reduce the effects of global warming as trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen in the atmosphere.
Hunting and Poaching: Human beings hunt and poach animals for personal benefits which endangers the wildlife. Forest management should be strict and precise to deal with the issue.
Conclusion

Wildlife is important part of nature and helps balance the natural environment. The main aim of wildlife conservation is to save and preserve the wildlife for the future generations to enjoy. Wildlife conservation has become an important practice as human activities have affected wildlife negatively. Several programs are initiated by government for wildlife conservation. There are many government agencies and NGO’s working for wildlife conservation. Various campaigns and NGO’s are promoting the causes of wildlife conservation to protect nature as a whole.

Paragraph on Nature 150 words
Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.

Natural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms. Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth.

Paragraph on Nature 200 words
Nature refers to the natural resources and natural surroundings. The life species in nature are interrelated and create balance in nature. They form a natural food chain through which energy is passed to all the species. The series of organisms in which each organism feeds on the one below it in the sequence is called the food chain in natural ecosystem. Food chain includes several plants, organisms, animals and other living species. This natural food chain is the source of energy for the forest species. The energy is passed from one creature to the other which helps them grow and survive.

For example in forest deer feeds on the grass and green plants and the tiger feeds on the deer. Plants get their energy form sunlight and nutrients from soil. Deer is herbivores animal. Herbivores animals depend on plants for energy and are vegetarians. Tiger is carnivorous animal. Carnivorous animals eat herbivores and sometimes other carnivorous for energy. So there is a whole chain that includes plants, herbivores, carnivorous and plants consume energy from sunlight. And there are lots of animals that eat plants and meat both. These are called omnivorous animals. For instance, black beer is an omnivorous animal. Some omnivorous also eat dead animals and those are called scavengers. Thus, the chain goes on.

All the species on earth are important for the survival of entire series of organisms and to balance the natural cycle.

Paragraph on Nature 400 words
Nature refers to the natural resources, plants, animals and other forms of living and non living things that exist naturally in the universe. One very important part of nature is the wildlife. Nature includes rich and diverse wildlife. Wildlife mostly refers to the undomesticated animal species, but also comprises other species like plant, fungi and other organisms that exist and penetrate independent of human intrusion. Wildlife is present in the entire ecosystem including forests, deserts, rainforests and grasslands. Diverse forms of wildlife can be found in these areas.

Some animals are domesticated by human beings. Human beings also use animals for personal activities or entertainment and serve them as pets taking them away from their natural habitat. Animals are also caged in the zoo for public display and this disrupts their skills to hunt their meals independently and survive wild in the nature. In modern times, interest and concern for natural environment has seen a rise. Many activists have objected to the exploitation of wildlife for human benefits.

Threats to Nature and Wildlife

Global Warming: Global warming is raising the temperature of the climate on earth and is responsible for severe natural calamities like flood, hurricanes, droughts, etc. This also causes danger to our natural environment, adding pressure to our wildlife species and their habitat. Global warming can cause loss of several wild life species.
Overuse of Wildlife: Due to rise in population there is upsurge in use of wildlife and plant species by human beings for food, clothing, medicine, pets and several other purposes. If we use more than the nature could supply then some of the species might get exploited completely.
Deforestation: Due to personal needs, urbanization and development humans are clearing away forests. Forests are important for the natural cycle of ecosystem in which several animals feed on plants. It leads to the loss of habitat of several species. Forests are also important to reduce the effects of global warming as trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen in the atmosphere.
Hunting and Poaching: Human beings hunt and poach animals for personal benefits which endangers the wildlife. Forest management should be strict and precise to deal with the issue.
Conclusion

Wildlife is important part of nature and helps balance the natural environment. The main aim of wildlife conservation is to save and preserve the wildlife for the future generations to enjoy. Wildlife conservation has become an important practice as human activities have affected wildlife negatively. Several programs are initiated by government for wildlife conservation. There are many government agencies and NGO’s working for wildlife conservation. Various campaigns and NGO’s are promoting the causes of wildlife conservation to protect nature as a whole.
